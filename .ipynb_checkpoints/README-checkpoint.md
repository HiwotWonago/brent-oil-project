- Explored stationarity, trends, and volatility in the dataset
- Prepared foundational report

##  Structure
- `data/`: Datasets including oil prices and key events
- `notebooks/`: EDA and exploratory work
- `reports/`: Project planning documents
- `src/`: Python modules (empty for now)

##  Future tasks
- Implementing Bayesian Change Point detection using PyMC3
- Quantifing impact of detected structural breaks
- Building interactive dashboard for stakeholder exploration
